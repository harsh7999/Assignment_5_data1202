# Amazon Retail analysis
Here I am going to analyze the amazon dataset and at the end give my views on it.

## Description
In this code I have done visual, tabular and quantitative analysis of the retail monthly sales of amazon for the fiscal year 2019 in python. I can use the output to strategize marketing,distribution and production of electronic goods according to location type and revenue generated over a period of the year 2019. I have clean the data, performed analysis and created bar charts and line graph to draw conclusions.
